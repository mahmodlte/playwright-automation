# This is my first testing project using Playwright

## This testing has 3 test cases

- The first test case to visit google.com and check it's title
- the second test case is to visit Wikipedia and switch language to English and check if the url has switched to English
- The third test case is to do input test and check the search on Wikipedia searching for the term "PlayWright"

### To run the tests do the following

```javascript
npx playwright install

npx playwright test
```
